# betting_with_R_bookfiles

This repo is a temporary holding area for a book I've been putting together on sports betting with R. Some of the material will be reworked from [old posts on my blog](https://www.corywaters.com), other material is new.

I'm currently in the process of porting the examples from the [ArmchairAnalysis dataset](https://www.armchairanalysis.com) to the data from the [nflscrapR R package](https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data). ArmchairAnalysis is amazing and well worth the cost IMO, but for the purpose of a book I need data that's free for reuse.
